Contributing
=============

`cge_modeling` is an open source, collective effort. There are many ways in which you can help make it better. And all of them are welcome!

Contribute as an individual
------------------------------------
`cge_modeling` is a joint effort of many people, each contributing to the areas they like and have some expertise in, coordinating to try and cover all tasks.

Coding and documentation are the most common types of contributions, but there are many more things that you can do to help the `cge_modeling` effort which are just as important.

Contact us at `jessegrabowski@gmail.com ` or `jcamsalda@gmail.com` if you want to contribute to the project but are not sure where you can contribute or how to start.

Below there are some examples of non code nor doc contributions that could serve as an inspiration.

Report a bug or make a suggestion for improvement by opening an issue in Github. You can find the issues' board [here](https://github.com/jessegrabowski/cge_modeling/issues)

Teach about `cge_modeling` and advertise best practices by writing blogs or giving talks

Contribute via Pull Requests on GitHub
------------------------------------------------------------
We have a Pull request step-by-step and a Pull request checklist page to help in all the steps of the contributing process, from before your first ever contribution to regular contributions as a core contributor.

Etiquette for code contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you start working working on an issue, open a Draft pull request as soon as you make your first commit (see Pull request step-by-step).

Before opening a PR with a new feature, please make a proposal by opening an issue or Discussion with the maintainers.

Any issue without an open pull request is available for work. You can find the issues' board [here](https://github.com/users/jessegrabowski/projects/2/views/1)

If a pull request has no recent activity it may be closed, or taken over by someone else.

The specific timeframe for “recent” is hard to define as it depends on the contributor the specific code change, and other contextual factors.

The core devs will make their best judgement when opting to close PRs or reassign them to others.

If unsure if an issue ticket is available feel free to ask in the issue ticket. Note however, that per the previous point an open pull request is way to claim an issue ticket. Please do not make unrealistic pledges in the issue tickets.

It’s okay if you are delayed or need to take a break, but please leave a comment in the pull request if you cannot get it to a state where it can be merged. Depending on the change (urgent bugfix vs. new feature) the core devs can determine if the PR needs to be reassigned to get the work done.
